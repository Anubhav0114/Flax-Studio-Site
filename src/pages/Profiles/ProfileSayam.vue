                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>My name is Sayam and I am an intermediate Android and web developer. My journey into the world of
                        technology started at a young age, when I received my first computer as a gift from my parents. I
                        was fascinated by the endless possibilities that technology could offer and knew that I wanted to
                        pursue a career in this field.
                        As a child, I spent countless hours tinkering with my computer, learning how to code and developing
                        my own websites. This passion only grew stronger as I got older and I decided to pursue a degree in
                        computer science. During my time in college, I honed my skills in programming and began to
                        specialise in mobile app development.
                    </p>
                    <p>After completing my degree, I landed my first job as an Android developer at a startup. It was an
                        exciting opportunity for me, as I was able to work on cutting-edge technology and collaborate with
                        some of the brightest minds in the industry. Over time, I became an integral part of the team and
                        was tasked with leading the development of several high-profile apps.
                        As my career progressed, I began to explore web development and soon found myself equally passionate
                        about building websites and web applications. I decided to expand my skillset by taking courses in
                        web development and started working on my own personal projects in my spare time.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, I am a well-rounded developer with experience in both mobile and web development. I am
                        constantly striving to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends
                        in the industry. I take pride in my work and always strive to deliver the best possible results for
                        my clients and users.
                        Looking back on my journey so far, I am grateful for the opportunities that I have had and the
                        people who have supported me along the way. I am excited to see where my career takes me next and am
                        confident that I have the skills and drive to achieve great things in the world of technology.
                    </p>
